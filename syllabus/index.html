<h1 id="course-description">Course Description</h1>
<p>Scripting For The Web is an upper level programming course designed to cohesively work with the web as technology, primarily through Javascript and its dynamic libraries and frameworks. We will build websites and web applications for clients and servers that use live data and interactivity as input, giving this work shape and form through code.</p>
<p>This course is designed to be flexible to student learning goals and interests. The Web is an evolving platform and technology. We will be covering a large array of programming interfaces, languages, frameworks and applications including HTML, CSS, Javascript, the DOM, NodeJS, Express, APIs, markdown, Bash, Linux, Git. Our goal will be to treat the web as a space for exploration and as a platform we can shape and on which to build projects that we envision.</p>
<p>Some of our learning will be difficult. Students will need to consistently write code and build websites and web applications multiple days a week throughout the semester in order to reinforce their learning and to complete their projects. In addition to our assignments, students are expected to do research out of class, to spend time debugging and solving coding errors and challenges, and to be bold and take charge of their learning.</p>
<p>This class is in Math and Computer Science, cross-listed with New Media, and we will take an expansive view of the web as medium to manipulate through scripting. In addition to our technical work we will discuss topics relating to our use of this technology such as privacy, user experience, accessible design, open source culture, and abuses of social media.</p>
<h2 id="learning-objectives">Learning Objectives</h2>
<ul>
<li>a working knowledge of the underlying technology of the web and how to build websites and web applications on this platform</li>
<li>knowledge of basic software design patterns for software for the web, including asynchronous versus synchronous programming, hosting, client versus server, and responsive design</li>
<li>ability to demonstrate knowledge and application of a number of programming languages and contexts: Javascript, Node.js, the DOM, Linux systems, Version Control</li>
<li>ability to create and deploy a node-based web application with interaction, data persistence and data/API queries</li>

<h2 id="required-texts-and-tools">Required Texts and Tools</h2>
<ul>
<li>A computer to regularly work on set up and organized! We will be making so many websites in this class. You must have a good file structure and it is imperative that you back up your work!</li>
<li>A Web Browser. Firefox, Chromium, Brave are recommended.<br />
</li>
<li>A Text editor or IDE. This semester I am going to teach with Visual Studio code, but other editors are acceptable as well.</li>
<li>A notebook. Please bring a notebook and pen or pencil to every class. Use it to jot down notes, respond to prompts, and for in-class sketching.</li>
<li>A virtual home (a website, if you will) that will link to all of the work you create for this class.</li>

<h2 id="university-and-classroom-policies-and-rules">University and Classroom Policies and Rules</h2>
<h3 id="official-purchase-college-academic-integrity-policy">Official Purchase College Academic Integrity Policy</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The Purchase College academic integrity policy, <a href="https://www.purchase.edu/live/blurbs/840-academic-and-professional-integrity">purchase.edu/live/blurbs/840-academic-and-professional-integrity</a>, explicitly forbids cheating, plagiarism, and other forms of academic dishonesty. Plagiarism is the appropriation or imitation of the language, ideas, and/or thoughts of another person and the representation of them as one’s own original work. Students are responsible for familiarizing themselves with the definition of plagiarism and the acceptable methods of attribution.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Violation of any of the above may lead to formal disciplinary action and the following sanctions: * Minimum Sanction: Failing grade on the assignment or examination. Maximum Sanction: Expulsion * Recommended Sanction (First Offense): Failing grade for the course * Recommended Sanction (Second Offense): Expulsion</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Students who have any questions or doubts about whether any activity is academically permissible should check with the instructor.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Plagiarism and cheating are taken seriously. You will be held accountable for Purchase’s <a href="https://www.purchase.edu/offices/community-standards/student-code-of-conduct/section-a-academic-integrity/index.php">Student Code of Conduct for Academic Integrity</a>.</p>
<h3 id="class-policy-on-collaboration">Class policy on Collaboration</h3>
<p>I support collaborative learning with some important caveats.</p>
<p>Coding can be difficult, and struggling with the material is part of the learning process. Students are allowed to collaborate to learn from each other. Do not collaborate in order to simply find out a solution to a project. Each participant should contribute approximately equally, and what you turn in should be your own. Copying a solution from another student, even if you change a few minor things such as variable names, is not a collaboration. You may help someone learn something, but you can not tell them what to code. If you have questions about collaboration or academic integrity, get in touch with me via email, talk with me before or after class, or come to office hours.</p>
<h3 id="tutoring-support">Tutoring Support</h3>
<p>All students at Purchase College can take advantage of our tutoring services in the Learning Center and the Einstein Corner. This semester these will be held online via Zoom. These are free, 45-minute, peer-to-peer tutoring sessions in a variety of subjects and in writing across the disciplines. I encourage you to take advantage of this service to help you excel in this class, as well as your other courses. Please visit the <a href="https://www.purchase.edu/offices/learning-center/index.php">Learning Center</a> and <a href="https://www.purchase.edu/academics/school-of-natural-social-sciences/academic-support/index.php">Einstein Corner</a> websites for more information.</p>
<h2 id="homework">Homework</h2>
<p>You will have in-class and outside of class coursework and homework in the form of code sketches and projects. All work is to be submitted on time <strong>by noon on the day of classtime</strong>. For each day late, your grade will drop a part letter grade. For most assignments, you will link to a website hosted on the internet.</p>
<h2 id="academic-accessibility">Academic Accessibility</h2>
<p>It is my goal that this class be an accessible and welcoming experience for all students, including those with disabilities. You are welcome to talk to me at any point in the semester about course design concerns, but it is always best if we can talk as soon as possible about the need for any modifications. The Office of Disability Resources collaborates directly with students who identify documented disabilities to create accommodation plans, including testing accommodations, in order for students to access course content and validly demonstrate learning. For those students who may require accommodations, please call or email the Office of Disability Resources, (914) 251-6035, odr@purchase.edu.</p>
<h2 id="community-health-during-covid-19">Community Health During Covid-19</h2>
<p>To ensure that each of us has a healthy and safe learning experience, all students are required to remain informed and follow Purchase College Policy and/or any departmental, local, state, or federal laws, rules, or regulations for attending classes on campus and in a remote learning environment.</p>
<p>Within courses that involve in-person contact, all students, faculty members, staff, and visitors are required to adhere to the expectations outlined on the College’s COVID-19 website. Failure to comply with requirements (e.g. wearing masks, maintaining social distancing where applicable) will result in the request to leave the classroom for that in-person class session. Students may also be referred to the Office of Community Standards.</p>
<p>Do not enter campus buildings if you test positive for or are experiencing any symptoms of COVID-19. Contact your faculty and Health Services if you need to miss class because of COVID-19 symptoms or a positive COVID-19 test result. The conservatory/school will address on a case by case basis student absences due to COVID-19, while awaiting test results, or during quarantine.</p>
<h2 id="tentative-nature-of-the-syllabus">Tentative nature of the syllabus</h2>
<p>If needed, this syllabus and the course outline may (and will!) be revised to better suit the class. It is the responsibility of the students to keep up to date with any changes. Always check our class GitHub repository for the latest information. The most up-to-date syllabus will also be on the class Moodle.</p>
<h1 id="classroom-community">Classroom Community</h1>
<h2 id="attendance">Attendance</h2>
<p>We only have one of these a week!</p>
<p>Learning programming is a cumulative effort. More than most other courses each of our classes will build on what you have learned in previous classes. Missing class sets you back in this process. It is important that you attend every class.</p>
<p>Here’s my policy: Three absences will lower your grade by one letter. (i.e. an A will became a B). With each additional unexcused absences, the grade will drop an additional unit for each absence. I will take attendance at the beginning of class, often with a brief check-in quiz. If you miss the quiz or are more than 15 minutes late, that is the equivalence of an absence. If there is an emergency or otherwise extenuating circumstance that prevents you from attending class, please email me.</p>
<p>We will be covering critical concepts and working on code and projects in-class and you are responsible for reviewing our class site and reaching out to your peers outside of class time to catch up on what you have missed.</p>
<p>If you are sick, don’t come to class. Send me an email.</p>
<h2 id="discord">Discord</h2>
<p>We will be using the online messaging and chat software Discord. You can access it through a web browser or download a standalone application. For any big important news I will put official class announcements on the #announcements channel and I will also post it to Moodle or email the entire class.</p>
<p>You are welcome to ask and answer questions and have ongoing conversations. Please remember to be respectful and treat this as a virtual extension of the classroom.</p>
<h2 id="philosophy">Philosophy</h2>
<p>We are all learners and educators. Your experience and participation is valid and necessary. I am not the sole source of information. You are responsible for and encouraged to be in charge of your own education. Leap forth into areas of interest. Teach and learn from others.</p>
<ul>
<li>Please hold me accountable and point out areas that need to be improved.</li>
<li>This class is a collaboration between all of us. If you are feeling frustrated or stuck or left behind, please let me know immediately. I am here to help.</li>
<li>Sleep enough hours. Good sleep will get you through college, reduce stress, help you do well in class, and feel better.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="requesting-help">Requesting Help</h2>
<ul>
<li>You must work on your assignments throughout the week: this will maximize your recall of information.</li>
<li>When you get stuck on a problem with your code and can’t figure it out, take a good break such as taking a walk before coming back to try again. Try to explain your code’s logic to a friend or family member, even someone who doesn’t code.</li>
<li>Take advantage of our #questions channel on Discord. Please ask and answer questions there, and check to see if someone has already asked your question.</li>
<li>When contacting me about a coding issue, please send me a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve">minimal version</a> of your code, what you expected, and what you are getting. Please don’t message me last minute right before class. It can take me up to 24 hours to respond to emails, and longer on weekends or at the end of semesters. It is generally better for us to review your code together at office hours.</li>
